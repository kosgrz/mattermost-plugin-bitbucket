## Slash Commands

* **Subscribe to a respository:** Use `/bitbucket subscriptions add` to subscribe a Mattermost channel to receive notifications for new pull requests, issues, branch creation, and more in a Bitbucket repository.
  * For instance, to post notifications for issues, issue comments, and pull requests from mattermost/mattermost-server, use: `/bitbucket subscribe mattermost/mattermost-server issues,pulls,issue_comments`
* **Get to do items:** Use `/bitbucket todo` to get an ephemeral message with items to do in Bitbucket, including a list of assigned issues and pull requests awaiting your review.
* **Update settings:** Use `/bitbucket settings` to update your settings for notifications and daily reminders.

Run `/bitbucket help` to see what else the slash command can do.
